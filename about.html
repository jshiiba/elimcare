        <p class="indent">“Wait, where is your facility located?   I drove by a few times, but couldn’t find it.”  This is a typical response of potential clients looking to visit our residential care facilities.  Nestled in quiet neighborhoods of Folsom, Roseville, Orangevale and Granite Bay, California, one would not think they were anything but typical residential homes.    
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>The beauty of Elim Care RCFE facilities (Residential Care Facilities for the Elderly), is that they are indeed residential homes, or are designed to be as residential in character, feel and function as possible, allowing our residents the opportunity to live in a “home/family-like/loving/non-institutional” environment, without the sometimes overwhelming impersonal rooms, bright lights and constant noise associated with larger facilities.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Each home is generously staffed with appropriately trained, skilled and experienced caregivers, as well as professional and administrative personnel, allowing for around-the-clock care and supervision.  Nutritious meals and snacks are prepared and served fresh daily, and we pride ourselves in our ability to keep our residents very well-nourished.  Resident hygiene is of utmost priority.  Hence, showers, cleanliness and grooming are emphasized on a daily basis, supported by hairstyling professionals visiting monthly.   Many of our caregivers entertain our residents with their musicality: playing guitar, ukulele and classical/contemporary piano music, in addition to outside professionals that visit from time to time to entertain our residents.    
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Our goal is to treat each resident as individuals and respect their integrity.  We strive to learn as much about our residents’ lifestyle - past and present - from the beginning of their residency, in order to make the transition from their home into ours as smooth and stress-free as possible.  Their passions, hobbies, favorite foods, special family/friends, particular habits, likes and dislikes are all important factors in assisting the Elim Care staff in formulating a care program that will enhance the quality of life at Elim Care homes.  Our ultimate goal is to respect and serve the individualities of each and every resident.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>We specialize in “Personalized” care for your loved one and endorse our “open-door policy” for visitors to drop by any day and time that allows for the safety, dignity and convenience of all residents and visitors alike.  
        Please feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> for more information and to schedule a tour of our facilities.  It would be a pleasure to show you around and have our family meet yours!
