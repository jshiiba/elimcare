        <p class="indent">"The decision to move a loved one into a care facility is one of the hardest decisions a family has to make.  When the time came to move my husband, we visited several homes, but there was no comparison between Elim Care facilities and the others.  The owner came to our home to personally meet my husband, then after meeting him and seeing his home situation, she selected the Elim home that would best fit him.  From the day we moved him into Elim Glen, he was immediately part of their family, and I really mean family.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">Each of the caregivers treated him with such special care, just like they would their own family member.  Whether it was fixing a special meal of his favorite food, helping him exercise his mind and muscles or just providing a special treat, they make it a point to learn about each person and their life experiences.  They truly turned a difficult time into a welcoming experience for our family."

        <p class="indent">"My mother was one of the many elderly afflicted by Alzheimer's dementia. When my mother could no longer be adequately supervised by a larger dementia care facility I turned to the more intimate care she could receive at a residential board and care facility.  That’s when I found Elim Care.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
        My mother survived an additional five years benefiting from extremely attentive and individualized care. As her needs changed, I was able to have her transferred from an Elim Care facility in Folsom to a facility in my neighborhood of Woodbridge Ranch in Roseville.  This facility has been operating in my neighborhood for more than 10 years and the vast majority of my neighbors do not even know that a dementia care facility is operating in this house.The house blends into our neighborhood that seamlessly.

        <p class="indent">As a urologist, I deal with the elderly on a daily basis. Our society is in for a shock as the ranks of the physically well elderly with dementia expands. I only wish there were more quality facilities like those of Elim Care."

        <p class="indent">"I have worked in the elder care field for over 16 years and currently am a family consultant with Senior Care Solutions and Board President of Del Oro Caregiver Resource Center. In my day-to-day activities working with seniors and their caregivers I know how important it is to have quality senior care located close to homes of families and caregivers. I have known (the owner) for over 15 years and she is highly-respected by both professionals and families for the love, compassion and quality care she provides to her residents. Elim Care homes by far exceed the standard of care family's come to expect."

        <p class="indent">"My father decided he wanted to stay in CA when he was diagnosed with dementia, so his journey led him to Elim Oaks in May, 2010.  From day one excellent care has been faithfully provided to him.  The staff knows his likes, dislikes, beliefs, fears, habits, routines, and personality, and constantly provides expert, personal, appropriate, and loving attention to him.  Although his disease has robbed him of a great deal, the staff treats Dad with respect and enables him to maintain his dignity.  My East coast family and I are given a window into my dad’s world through numerous weekly e-mails, videos, pictures, and telephone calls; if needed, the information and contact is multiple times daily.  Jennifer, Farah, Rita, Ronnie, Del, and Lilibeth have made a positive impact on my dad and his quality of life; they have helped and sustained Dad in immeasurable, caring, thoughtful ways.  My family and I are extremely grateful that Dad’s decision led him to becoming part of the Elim family."
